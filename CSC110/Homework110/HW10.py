# Program to find all possible alignments of a pair of strings when adding
# gaps to the shorter string

# a string.  The input is a string, the output is a list of strings
# with a gap inserted into all positions of the input string

# Part B - The algorithm does 675 units of work. There were numerous counters placed throughout
# the code in order to count the amount of work done. The algorithm then did the counting
# by itself by counting every alignment and counting the comparisons that took place in the
# program and it just printed the amount of work done in the main function.
